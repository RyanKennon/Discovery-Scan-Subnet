# Subnet Host Discovery Scan

This project demonstrates the process of performing a host discovery scan against a defined subnet to identify active devices on a network. A discovery scan was configured and executed to detect responsive hosts within the target IP range. After the scan completed, logs were reviewed to verify results and confirm network visibility.

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure
- Azure Virtual Network
- Tenable (Vulnerability Scanner)

---

## Lab Objectives

- Configure and initiate a host discovery scan on a defined subnet  
- Identify active hosts within the network range  
- Review scan logs after completion

---

## Walkthrough

1. Log into **Tenable** and create a **Host Discovery Scan** with the following settings
   - **Scanner:** Local Scan Engine
   - **Target:** Virtual Network Subnet
